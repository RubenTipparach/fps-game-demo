"""Fetches the pinned character packs into a cache outside the repository, and checks them.

It owns the allowlist in tools/deps/character_packs.json: reading it, where the cache is, the
SHA-256 check of every pack, unpacking a verified pack, and telling whether a file on disk is
a file of a pack. It lives in tools/deps, beside the list it reads, and is plain Python with
no Blender import, because the NPC builds (tools/blender/build_npcs.py, build_npc_clips.py)
import it inside Blender to resolve every asset against the same packs the fetch verified
(openspec/changes/archive/2026-09-28-npc-characters, design section 2). One implementation of the pin.

The cache is $UNDERCITY_DEPS, or ~/.cache/undercity/deps when that is unset. It must not be
inside the repository: the packs are 340 MB, and one of them is a GPL tool that never ships.

Run:  python3 tools/deps/fetch_character_tools.py [--verify] [--only <pack id>]
  (no options)   downloads each missing pack, skips a pack already cached with the right
                 hash, and exits non-zero naming the pack when a hash differs or a pack
                 can't be fetched
  --verify       downloads nothing; checks every cached pack against its pin
